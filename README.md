# OrbIndicatorsRevisited
Hey, RobTop.

Fix your orb indicators to be more responsive to the player's gravitational direction.

It shouldn't be that hard.

*Mod author's note: Earlier drafts of this mod description were supposed to be in the open letter format, where they would also mention how accounting for horizontally or vertically flipped jump orbs causes more problems than what this mod would fix. Sadly, all of them were deemed too "inflammatory", so now there's just this really awkwardly written pair run-on sentence instead, because the imperfections have to be noted somewhere after all.*

 Thanks to [altalk23](https://github.com/altalk23) and [Alphalaneous](https://github.com/Alphalaneous) for the assists!
