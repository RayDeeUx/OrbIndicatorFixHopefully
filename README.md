# OrbIndicatorsRevisited
Hey, RobTop.

Remember how orb indicators still don't rotate correctly when the player changed directions from the arrow trigger? 

***HEY, ROBTOP, __<u>I'M TALKING TO YOU</u>!__***

Of course __<u>you</u>__ of all people would forget to fix such a silly thing.

Well, thanks to your laziness, there isn't even a way to fix this properly for orbs that were horizontally or vertically flipped in the level editor without causing more problems than there were to begin with.

Thanks a lot for your half-baked orb indicator code.

You lazy bum.
