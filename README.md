# OrbIndicatorsRevisited
Fixes orb indicators to be more responsive to the player's gravitational direction.

(Well, most of them.)

*Mod author's note: Earlier drafts of this mod description were supposed to be in the open letter format, where they would also mention how applying these changes to horizontally or vertically flipped jump orbs with custom rotations causes more problems than what this mod would fix. Sadly, all of them were deemed too "inflammatory", so now there's just this really awkwardly written pair of run-on sentences instead, because the imperfections have to be noted somewhere after all.*
