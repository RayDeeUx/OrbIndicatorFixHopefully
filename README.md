# OrbIndicatorsRevisited
Hey, RobTop.

Fix your orb indicators.

It shouldn't be that hard.

*Mod author's note: Earlier drafts of this mod description were supposed to be in the open letter format, where would also mention how accounting for horizontally or vertically flipped jump orbs causes more problems than what this mod would fix. Sadly, all of them were deemed too "inflammatory", so now there's just this really awkwardly written run-on sentence instead.*

 Thanks to [altalk23](https://github.com/altalk23) and [Alphalaneous](https://github.com/Alphalaneous) for the assists!
