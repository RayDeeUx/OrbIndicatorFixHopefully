# OrbIndicatorsRevisited
Hey, RobTop.

Fix your orb indicators.

It shouldn't be that hard.

*Mod author's note: There was going to be a open letter here that would also mention how accounting for horizontally or vertically flipped jump orbs causes more problems than what this mod would fix, but it was deemed too "inflammatory", so now there's just this really awkwardly written run-on sentence instead.*
