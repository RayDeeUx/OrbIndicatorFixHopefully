# OrbIndicatorsRevisited
Fixes orb indicators to be more responsive to the player's gravitational direction.

(Well, most of them.)

*Mod author's note: Orb indicators will point in the wrong direction when an orb is horizontally or vertically flipped with custom rotation values. Adjusting the source code for these incredibly uncommon scenarios is not worth the effort.*
