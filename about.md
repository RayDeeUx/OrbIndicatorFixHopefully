# OrbIndicatorsRevisited
Fixes orb indicators to be more responsive to the player's gravitational direction.

(Well, most of them.)

*Mod author's note: Orb indicators will be pointing in the wrong direction when they belong to a horizontally or vertically flipped jump orb with custom rotation values. Trying to adjust the source code for these incredibly uncommon scenarios is not worth the effort, even if entropy and the heat death of the universe were physically impossible.*
